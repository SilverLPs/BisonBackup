BisonBackup is a lightweight and modular backup script framework. It acts as a script runner that executes specified subscripts (called *Modules*) based on a user-defined configuration file (referred to as a *Backup Plan*).

### IMPORTANT:
This is just a personal project I worked on for my own needs. It‚Äôs definitely not a professional product, nor is it meant to be treated like one. I‚Äôm only sharing it in case someone else might find it useful, but please don‚Äôt expect anything close to finished, polished, or well-developed software. Make sure to read the License and Disclaimer section below in this README before even thinking about using this script or its modules.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Modular Design:** Integrate existing or your own script *Modules* and run them with customized parameters.
- **Backup Plans:** Centralized `.ini` configuration files to manage *Tasks* and their execution parameters.
- **Dynamic Task Execution:** Automatically runs *Tasks* with specified *Modules* and paths.
- **Full Portability:** BisonBackup is entirely written in pure Bash, requiring no additional dependencies. It should run seamlessly on any system that supports the Bash shell or its syntax.
- **Simplicity by Design:** Transform any Bash script into a flexible *Module* that receives parameters in a standardized argument format, as defined by the *Backup Plan*.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SilverLPs/BisonBackup.git
cd BisonBackup
```
2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x bisonbackup.sh
```
3. Create your own *Backup Plan* (see the **Backup Plan Structure** sections for details). Ensure the specified *Modules* are stored in the directory specified by "ModulePath" in your *Backup Plan*.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Command

Run BisonBackup with your *Backup Plan*:
```bash
bisonbackup.sh <path-to-backup-plan.ini>
```

### Output

When executed, BisonBackup provides detailed runtime information, including:

- Hostname
- Operating System and Kernel
- Current Directory
- Execution Timestamp
- User Information
- Plan Details (name, location, and associated paths)

It is advisable to redirect all output to a text file and retain it for future reference and analysis.

## üóíÔ∏è Backup Plan Structure

A *Backup Plan* is a simple `.ini` file that defines the *Tasks* and *Modules* to be executed. It is structured into multiple sections:

### Plan Section
The Plan Section specifies the overall configuration for the *Backup Plan*. This section must appear at the top of the configuration file and is identified by `[Plan]` in brackets. Each *Backup Plan* requires a unique Plan Section.

- **Name**: The name of the *Backup Plan*.
- **Path**: The working directory for *Tasks*. If omitted, defaults to the current directory.
- **ModulePath**: The directory where the *Modules* are located.

### Task Sections
Each *Task* is defined in its own section, specifying the *Module* and parameters required for execution. Task sections begin with a unique custom name enclosed in brackets, which must not be reused elsewhere in the *Backup Plan*.

- **TaskModule**: The *Module* to be executed for the *Task*. This is a required parameter.
- **TaskPath**: (Optional) The directory where the *Task* should be executed. If specified, BisonBackup will temporarily switch to this directory during the *Task's* execution.
- **ARGUMENTS**: Parameters written in uppercase (e.g., `ARGUMENTS`) are custom arguments passed to the specified *Module*. For details on a *Module‚Äôs* parameters, refer to its documentation.

#### Example
```ini
[Plan]
Name=Demo Plan
Path=/home/demouser/
ModulePath=/home/demouser/.local/bisonbackup/modules/

[Hello world]
TaskModule=bisonbackup.general.command
TaskPath=
COMMAND="echo hello world test 123"

[Run example script]
TaskModule=bisonbackup.general.script
TaskPath=/home/demouser/myscripts/
SCRIPT="mycommand.sh"
ARGUMENTS="--myparameter=examplevalue"
```

## üß© Adding Modules

*Modules* are external scripts that are organized into *Packages* and located in the directory specified by the `ModulePath` parameter in the *Backup Plan*. A *Package* name usually combines the source of the *Package* and the *Package* theme (e.g., `bisonbackup.general`). *Modules* are executed by BisonBackup based on the *Task* configuration defined in the *Backup Plan*.

### Example Module Directory Structure
/home/demouser/.local/bisonbackup/modules/bisonbackup.general
- command.sh
- script.sh
- filelist.sh
- remove.sh

### Module Naming Convention
In the *Backup Plan*, *Modules* are referenced using a hierarchical naming convention:  

**Example:** `bisonbackup.general.filelist`

-   **bisonbackup**: Indicates the source of the *Package*.
-   **general**: Refers to the *Package* containing a group of related *Modules*.
-   **filelist**: Specifies the *Module* itself, corresponding to the script `filelist.sh`.

### Module Execution
Each *Module* is executed using the parameters specified in its corresponding task section, passed as arguments in the format `SOURCE=/home/demouser/filepath DESTINATION=/home/demouser/filepath2`.

### Available Module Packages
BisonBackup's functionality is entirely provided by its *Modules*. Several "official" *Packages* are available as part of the BisonBackup project:

- üß∞ **[bisonbackup.general:](https://github.com/SilverLPs/bisonbackup.general)** 
General-purpose *Modules* for simple operations, such as running commands or handling file operations.
- üåè **[bisonbackup.networktransfer:](https://github.com/SilverLPs/bisonbackup.networktransfer)**
*Modules* for transferring files and directories over various network protocols.
- üëæ **[bisonbackup.gitutils:](https://github.com/SilverLPs/bisonbackup.gitutils)**
*Modules* for interacting with Git repositories.
- üè¶ **[bisonbackup.borg:](https://github.com/SilverLPs/bisonbackup.borg)**
*Modules* designed for handling backups using BorgBackup.

These *Packages* are currently incomplete and contain only the specific *Modules* I have needed so far. Additional *Modules* may be added in the future if the project evolves.

In addition to these official *Packages*, I have also developed some personal module packages that are not part of the official BisonBackup project:

- üìß **[silverlps.email:](https://github.com/SilverLPs/silverlps.email)**
*Modules* for handling email operations.
- üí¨ **[silverlps.discord:](https://github.com/SilverLPs/silverlps.discord)**
*Modules* for interacting with the Discord platform.

For more details on the available module packages, refer to their respective documentation.

## üìú Logging

BisonBackup outputs logs directly to the console, including:
- Start and end timestamps for *Tasks*
- *Task* names
- *Task* output
- Errors (e.g., missing *Modules* or paths)
